### TOS 1.4 UK disassembly

I am slowly hand-disassembling parts of TOS 1.4 UK (md5sum 036c5ae4f885cbf62c9bed651c6c58a8).

NOTE: I'm using plain GCC here, not m68k-atari-mint-gcc.

I have referred to other sources for some of the information used to reverse-engineer the binary, including the book Atari ST Internals, the book The Atari Compendium, and Thorsten Otto's TOS 3.06 source code.
